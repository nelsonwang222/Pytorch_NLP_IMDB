# Pytorch_NLP_IMDB
The project is to make sentiment analysis of IMDB reviews by using Natural Language Processing.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Stanford’s Large Movie Review Dataset as the dataset for sentiment analysis. This dataset is divided into two datasets for training and testing purposes, each containing 25,000 movie reviews downloaded from IMDb. In each dataset, the number of comments labeled as “positive” and “negative” is equal.
